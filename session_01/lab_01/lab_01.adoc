= Lab 1 - From Zero to Pushing Your First Application

== Target

. If you haven't already, download the latest release of the Cloud Foundry CLI from https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases for your operating system and install it.

. Ask your instructor to provide you with a username and password to use when connecting to Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

. Set the API target for the CLI.  Note that your endpoint may be different than the below.  Check with your instructor for the correct value to use throughout today's workshop.  In larger workshops, some may use a different Cloud Foundry instance than others.
+
----
$ cf api --skip-ssl-validation https://api.pcf7.cloud.fe.pivotal.io
----

. Login to Pivotal Cloud Foundry:
+
----
$ cf login
----
+
Follow the prompts, choosing the development space.

. Throughout the labs, you will see reference to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Apps Manager.  This user interface to Cloud Foundry makes it much easier to visualize what applications you are running, scale them, view their logs, bind services, etc.  You can access this UI at any time by opening https://apps.pcf7.cloud.fe.pivotal.io in a browser and logging in with your username and password.  It may be helpful to bookmark this URL for the duration of the workshop.


== Build and Push!

. Change to the _cf-towns_ sample application directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/session_01/lab_01/cf-towns
----

. Push the application!
+
----
cf push uktowns -s windows2012R2 -b binary_buildpack 
```
If diego is not enabled by default then you will need to add --no-start to the end of the above command and then run the following
```
cf enable-diego uktowns
cf start uktowns
```
Note: this will require the enable-diego CLI plug [available here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-enabler)

You can then go to the app URL and you will see a message highlighting that you need to bind a MySQL Service, so go ahead and create and bind the service as follows
```
cf create-service service-name plan-name mysqlServiceName
cf bind-service uktowns mysqlServiceName
cf restage uktowns
```
Then re-visit the URL to see the sample app showing a list of UK Towns

You should see output similar to the following listing. Take a look at the listing callouts for a play-by-play of what's happening:
+
====

[fix  below with console output]
----
<1> The CLI is using a manifest to provide necessary configuration details such as application name, memory to be allocated, and path to the application artifact.
Take a look at `manifest.yml` to see how.
<2> In most cases, the CLI indicates each Cloud Foundry API call as it happens.
In this case, the CLI has created an application record for _Spring Music_ in your assigned space.
<3> All HTTP/HTTPS requests to applications will flow through Cloud Foundry's front-end router called http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router].
Here the CLI is creating a route with random word tokens inserted (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!) to prevent route collisions across the default `cfapps.io` domain.
<4> Now the CLI is _binding_ the created route to the application.
Routes can actually be bound to multiple applications to support techniques such as http://www.mattstine.com/2013/07/10/blue-green-deployments-on-cloudfoundry[blue-green deployments].
<5> The CLI finally uploads the application bits to PWS. Notice that it's uploading _90 files_! This is because Cloud Foundry actually explodes a ZIP artifact before uploading it for caching purposes.
<6> Now we begin the staging process. The https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack[Java Buildpack] is responsible for assembling the runtime components necessary to run the application.
<7> Here we see the version of the JRE that has been chosen and installed.
<8> And here we see the version of Tomcat that has been chosen and installed.
<9> The complete package of your application and all of its necessary runtime components is called a _droplet_.
Here the droplet is being uploaded to PWS's internal blobstore so that it can be easily copied to one or more _http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/diego/diego-components.html#cell-components[Diego Cells]_ for execution.
<10> The CLI tells you exactly what command and argument set was used to start your application.
<11> Finally the CLI reports the current status of your application's health.
You can get the same output at any time by typing `cf app spring-music`.
====

. Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI.  You can find the route by typing `cf apps`, and it will look something like `http://spring-music-reversible.pcf10.cloud.fe.pivotal.io`

Be sure to click on the ``information icon'' in the top right-hand corner of the UI.
This gives you important information about the state of the currently running _Spring Music_ instance, including what Spring Profiles are turned on and what Cloud Foundry services are bound.
It will become important in the next lab!
