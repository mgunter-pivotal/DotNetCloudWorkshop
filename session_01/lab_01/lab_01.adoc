= Lab 1 - From Zero to Pushing Your First Application

== Target

. If you haven't already, download the latest release of the Cloud Foundry CLI from https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases for your operating system and install it.

. Ask your instructor to provide you with a username and password to use when connecting to Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

. Set the API target for the CLI.  Note that your endpoint may be different than the below.  Check with your instructor for the correct value to use throughout today's workshop.  In larger workshops, some may use a different Cloud Foundry instance than others.
+
----
PCF api Endpoint:  https://api.pcf7.cloud.fe.pivotal.io
----
+
. Login to Pivotal Cloud Foundry:
+
----
$ cf login -a  https://api.pcf7.cloud.fe.pivotal.io --skip-ssl-validation
----
+
Follow the prompts, choosing the development space.

. Throughout the labs, you will see reference to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Apps Manager.  This user interface to Cloud Foundry makes it much easier to visualize what applications you are running, scale them, view their logs, bind services, etc.  You can access this UI at any time by opening https://apps.pcf7.cloud.fe.pivotal.io in a browser and logging in with your username and password.  It may be helpful to bookmark this URL for the duration of the workshop.


== Build and Push!

. Change to the _uk-towns-dotnet_ sample application directory:

+
----
cd $COURSE_HOME/session_01/lab_01/uk-towns-dotnet
----
+
. Push the application! (replacing XX with your initials or student number)
+
----
cf push uktownsXX -s windows2012R2 -b binary_buildpack 
----
+
. You should see output similar to the following listing. 
Take a look at the listing callouts for a play-by-play of what's happening:

<1> In most cases, the CLI indicates each Cloud Foundry API call as it happens.
In this case, the CLI has created an application record for _uktowns_ in your assigned space.
<2> All HTTP/HTTPS requests to applications will flow through Cloud Foundry's front-end router called http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router].
Here the CLI is creating a route with the name of the app.  To prevent route collisions across the default `pcf7.cloud.fe.pivotal.io` domain, the same route cannot be used by two apps. Ask your instructor about techniques to avoid collisions. Hint: this will be covered later.
<3> Now the CLI is _binding_ the created route to the application.
Routes can actually be bound to multiple applications to support techniques such as http://www.mattstine.com/2013/07/10/blue-green-deployments-on-cloudfoundry[blue-green deployments].
<4> The CLI finally uploads the application bits to PCF. Notice that it's uploading _90 files_! This is because Cloud Foundry actually explodes a ZIP artifact before uploading it for caching purposes.
<5> Now we begin the staging process. In General, Buildpacks are responsible for assembling the runtime components necessary to run the application.
<6> The CLI tells you exactly what command and argument set was used to start your application.
<7> Finally the CLI reports the current status of your application's health.
You can get the same output at any time by typing `cf app uktownsXX`.
====
+
. Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI.  You can find the route by typing `cf apps`, and it will look something like `http://uktowns.pcf7.cloud.fe.pivotal.io`

. You will see a message highlighting that you need to bind a MySQL Service, so go ahead and create and bind the service as follows

+

+

+
```
cf create-service service-name plan-name mysqlServiceName
cf bind-service uktownsXX mysqlServiceName
cf restage uktownsXX
```
+

. Then re-visit the URL to see the sample app showing a list of UK Towns
